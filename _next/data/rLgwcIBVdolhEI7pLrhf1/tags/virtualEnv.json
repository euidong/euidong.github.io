And It can get good performance in read.\n\nEspectially 5.7 version is stable version. So industry use this version for development or test.\n\n![why-use-5.7](/images/why-use-5.7.png)\n\nIf you want get more information [click this](https://mysql.com)\n\n## Docker\n\nDocker is a virtualization application.\nIt is usally show more performance than any other virtualization machine program.\nBecase It use container.\nSo, It can make more efficient feature.\nIf you want get database running in Linux then you just build and run container that has database with Linux.\nWhen you anymore need taht database, you just delete that container.\nIt's so simple, clear.
